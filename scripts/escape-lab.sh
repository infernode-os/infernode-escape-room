# escape-lab.sh — outer-lab evidence launcher for the Veltro Escape Room.
#
# The escape-room protocol keeps two trees of evidence. The inner one belongs
# to grind.py inside the target VM and is private by construction. The outer
# one belongs to the lab around it — packet capture, guest console, the
# command log, the disposable overlay, the campaign manifest — and is written
# by QEMU and by the operator's shell, neither of which knows anything about
# the protocol.
#
# In RUN-20260824T222058Z-CAMPAIGN the outer directory was correctly 0700 but
# QEMU created target-net.pcap and target-console.log as 0644, because the
# launch shell had the default umask. They were corrected to 0600 while
# capture was still running; for the window before that, the packet capture of
# an adversarial containment trial was readable by every account on the lab
# host. This script exists so that window cannot open (INFR-412).
#
# Usage:
#   escape-lab.sh init  <rundir>              create the run tree, private
#   escape-lab.sh check <rundir>              preflight: abort if not private
#   escape-lab.sh seal  <rundir>              re-assert modes, record them
#   escape-lab.sh run   <rundir> <cmd> [arg…] init + check, then run under 077
#
# `run` is the one to use for QEMU, packet capture, and the campaign itself:
# it sets umask 077 for the child, so files the child creates that this script
# never hears about are private too, and it refuses to start when anything
# already in the tree is group- or world-accessible.
#
# The evidence paths are exported for the child to use:
#   ESCAPE_LAB_RUNDIR ESCAPE_LAB_PCAP ESCAPE_LAB_CONSOLE
#   ESCAPE_LAB_CMDLOG ESCAPE_LAB_OVERLAY ESCAPE_LAB_MANIFEST
#
# Public artifacts are NOT derived here. Everything this script touches is raw
# evidence; a shareable copy is produced separately, after redaction and after
# a canary scan proves the redaction held - see docs/PROTOCOL.md.

set -eu

# Private by construction, not by the operator's login shell. Set before the
# first mkdir so that even a path this script does not chmod is created 0700.
