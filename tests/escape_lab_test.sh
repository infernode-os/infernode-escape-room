#
# INFR-412. In RUN-20260824T222058Z-CAMPAIGN the private evidence directory
# was 0700 but QEMU created target-net.pcap and target-console.log as 0644,
# because the launch shell never set a restrictive umask. They were corrected
# while capture was already running. These tests hold the launcher to creating
# evidence private, refusing to start over an exposure, and sealing modes at
# the end.

# Run from project root: ./tests/host/escape_lab_evidence_test.sh
